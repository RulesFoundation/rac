    CBO projects inflation (C-CPI-U) based on their macroeconomic
    forecast. These projections are used for baseline budget estimates
    and policy analysis. Values are index levels (December 1999 = 100).

  # but these can be derived from their inflation uncertainty

    2025:
      p10: 177.4   # 10th percentile
      p50: 180.2   # Median (point estimate)
      p90: 183.0   # 90th percentile
    2030:
      p10: 188.1
      p50: 199.5

  methodology: |
    CBO's inflation projections reflect their assessment of:
    - Federal Reserve monetary policy trajectory
    - Labor market conditions
    - Energy and commodity prices
    - Global economic conditions

    Long-run inflation converges to approximately 2.0% annually,
    consistent with the Fed's inflation target.
