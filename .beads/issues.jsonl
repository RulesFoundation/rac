Support indexed lookups for parameterized values\n\nTasks:\n- [ ] Create parameter YAML schema and loader\n- [ ] Update agent prompt to generate parameter references instead of hardcoded values  \n- [ ] Update executor to resolve parameter paths from YAML files\n- [ ] Migrate existing test parameters to YAML structure","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-07T23:03:08.101439-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-07T23:44:32.548775-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-07T23:44:32.548775-05:00"}

Parameters declare which statute section defines their indexing (e.g., §32(j))\n2. Indexing rules specify: base year, index (CPI-U, C-CPI-U), rounding\n3. Three-tier precedence: published \u003e projected \u003e calculated\n4. Separate historical vs forecast index values conceptually\n5.
