{"id":"cosilico-engine-9kk","title":"Implement statute-organized parameter structure","description":"Currently the DSL agent hardcodes parameter values in match expressions. Per the DSL spec, parameters should be:\n\n1. Stored in YAML files at paths mirroring statute structure (e.g., rules/us/federal/irs/credits/eitc.yaml)\n2. Referenced by path in formulas: parameter(gov.irs.eitc.phase_in_rate[n_children])\n3. Support indexed lookups for parameterized values\n\nTasks:\n- [ ] Create parameter YAML schema and loader\n- [ ] Update agent prompt to generate parameter references instead of hardcoded values  \n- [ ] Update executor to resolve parameter paths from YAML files\n- [ ] Migrate existing test parameters to YAML structure","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-07T23:03:08.101439-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-07T23:44:32.548775-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-07T23:44:32.548775-05:00"}
{"id":"cosilico-engine-b0z","title":"Implement inflation indexing with precedence tiers","description":"Design and implement proper inflation indexing:\n\n1. Parameters declare which statute section defines their indexing (e.g., §32(j))\n2. Indexing rules specify: base year, index (CPI-U, C-CPI-U), rounding\n3. Three-tier precedence: published \u003e projected \u003e calculated\n4. Separate historical vs forecast index values conceptually\n5. Support projecting future values when official values unavailable\n\nKey insight: The agent should understand indexing rules from statute and apply them correctly, not just copy hardcoded values.","status":"in_progress","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-08T01:20:17.238305-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-08T01:20:22.209238-05:00"}
