## Abstract

We demonstrate that large language models can automatically encode statutory provisions into executable code by using existing implementations as oracles for reinforcement learning. Our agentic loop achieves 95%+ accuracy on tax provisions ranging from simple formulas to complex multi-branch calculations, with costs under $1 per provision. We find evidence of transfer learning—provisions encoded later require fewer iterations—and identify systematic failure modes that inform human oversight requirements.
