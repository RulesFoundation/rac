# Labor Supply: Extensive Margin
#
# How labor force participation changes in response to participation tax rates.
# The participation tax rate is the effective tax on moving from non-work to work.

  # The participation tax rate calculation
  ptr_calculation:
    description: "PTR = (taxes_if_working - taxes_if_not + benefits_if_not - benefits_if_working) / earnings_if_working"
    components:
      - income_tax_increase
      - payroll_tax
      - benefit_phaseout  # SNAP, Medicaid, housing, etc.
      - eitc_gain  # EITC offsets high PTR for low earners

  application:
    method: logit
    formula: "P(employed) = logit(baseline_prob + elasticity * ptr_change)"
