# Taxable Income Elasticity
#
# Broader measure than labor supply: captures all responses to taxation including
# hours worked, effort, tax avoidance, income timing, and income shifting.
#
# This is the key parameter for revenue forecasting.

  description: Percent change in taxable income per percent change in net-of-tax rate

  estimates:
    - elasticity: 0.25
      confidence_interval: [0.12, 0.40]
      source: "Saez, Slemrod, Giertz 2012, JEL"
      url: "https://doi.org/10.1257/jel.50.1.3"
      population: general
      notes: "Preferred estimate from literature review; controls for mean reversion"

    - elasticity: 0.40
      confidence_interval: [0.20, 0.60]

      population: high_income
      threshold: 100_000
      notes: "Higher earners more responsive; includes avoidance channels"

    - elasticity: 0.57
      confidence_interval: [0.30, 0.90]
      source: "Feldstein 1995, JPE"
      population: top_bracket
      notes: "Often cited but may overstate due to income shifting around TRA86"

    - elasticity: 0.15
      confidence_interval: [0.05, 0.25]
      source: "Giertz 2007, NTJ"
      population: below_median_income
      notes: "Lower response for those with less scope for avoidance"

  components:
    description: "ETI captures multiple behavioral channels"
    real_labor_supply: 0.10  # Hours and effort
    avoidance: 0.08  # Legal tax minimization
    timing: 0.05  # Shifting income across years
    form_shifting: 0.02  # Wage vs. capital income

  caveats:
    - "ETI is not structural - varies with tax code complexity"
    - "High estimates may reflect income shifting, not real response"
    - "Long-run ETI may differ from short-run"

  application:
    method: proportional
    formula: "taxable_income_new = taxable_income_old * (1 + ETI * log((1-mtr_new)/(1-mtr_old)))"
