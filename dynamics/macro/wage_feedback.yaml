# Macroeconomic Feedback: Wage Response
#
# In general equilibrium, changes in labor supply affect wages.
# This is important for large-scale policy changes.
#
# Note: This is partial general equilibrium. Full GE would require
# integrating with a macro model.

  labor_demand_elasticity:
    description: Percent change in wages per percent change in labor supply
    estimate: -0.30
    confidence_interval: [-0.50, -0.15]
    source: "Hamermesh 1993, Labor Demand"
    notes: "Negative because more supply → lower wages (standard downward-sloping demand)"

  thresholds:
    description: Only apply wage feedback for large aggregate changes
    min_labor_supply_change: 0.01  # 1% aggregate change
    rationale: "Small policy changes don't meaningfully affect equilibrium wages"

  application:
    method: iterative
    steps:
      - "Calculate labor supply response to policy"
      - "If aggregate_change > threshold, calculate wage adjustment"
      - "Re-run labor supply with adjusted wages"
      - "Iterate until convergence"
    convergence_threshold: 0.001
    max_iterations: 10

    state_level_policies:
      elasticity_multiplier: 0.5  # Half the national effect due to mobility
      source: "Bound & Holzer 2000"
    federal_policies:
      elasticity_multiplier: 1.0

  caveats:
    - "Assumes closed economy (no trade effects)"
    - "Does not model capital adjustment"
    - "Constant returns to scale assumption"
    - "Short-run vs. long-run elasticities may differ"

  use_cases:
    appropriate:
      - "Large universal programs (UBI)"
      - "Major tax reform"
      - "Immigration policy"
    inappropriate:
      - "Small targeted tax credits"
      - "State-level benefit changes"
